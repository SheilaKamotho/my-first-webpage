    <p>My favorite things to do are reading novels and spending with in friends. I also love to bake, hence my baking business called Ess N Kay Bakery. My favorite place to be would be in nature. At the moment I am doing forests and streams but when I can afford it I think a beach would more pleasurable. I also love to play chess but I am definitely still a work in progress.Lastly I think it's safe to say I must just have found a new love-coding!</p>
